# Dithering, Quantization and Color Transfer

This repository composes of 2 different parts: dithering and quantization; color transfer between 2 reference images.
In the first part, images are tested with different levels of quantization and Floyd-Steinberg dithering. In the second part, colors of one image is transferred onto the other image.
